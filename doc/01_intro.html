## Goals

- Learn the basics of Python
- Learn the basic of Touch Designer
- Start coding 
- Never stop

---

## What is Python?

- Interpreted high-level programming language
- A scripting or "glue" language used to connect existing components
- For more read - https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/

---

## What is Touch Designer

- one
- two 
- three

### Warning

- This workshop is more about Python than Touch Designer 
- Not enough time :(
- Lots of good resources including tutorials

---

## Why Python?

- Well documented
- Low barrier to entry
- Productive - used in media post production and VFX
- Fun!

### Why not Python

- Slow
- "Old"

---

## Why Touch Designer

- Powerful and scalable
- Procedural real-time media tool
- Scratchpad for ideas
- Free version

## Why not Touch Designer

- Windows only
- Commercial product
- Niche, small user base (large events, media arts, high end real-time production)

## Stack

- `Windows` is the operating system
- `Touch Designer' is the application
- `python3` (version 3) is the "language"
